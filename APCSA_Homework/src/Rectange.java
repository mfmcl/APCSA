o	 toString() will print „I am Rectangle with PointA, PointB“
o	 randomSize() will set random points A and C
o	 getArea() method will return a number of area covered by rectangle () 
|X1-X2|*|Y1- Y2|
o	 moveIt(int) will increase both points‘ X coordinate.

3.	Inside your main program generate 2 times random Rectangle, 
-	Using toString() method print points.
-	Call moveIt(50)
-	Using toString() method print points.
-	get their area
