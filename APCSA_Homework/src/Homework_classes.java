Practice classes.
Inside or outside your homework source code java file
1.	Define a class Point
-	Fields: private Int CoordinateX, private Int CoordinateY
-	Constructors take either non or both (int X, int Y) arguments, where X and Y are from <-100,100> closed interval
-	Methods:
o	 private setCoordinates(int, int) will set CoordinateX, CoordinateY
o	 private getCoordinateX() will return X
o	 private getCoordinateX() will return Y
o	toString will print „I am a point with coordinate X: 52, coordinate Y:82“ You can use only getter methods
o	randomPosition() will set random numbers of coordinates. You can use only Setter methods
o	 changeX(int) will increase the X coordinate number by the given number
2.	Define a class Rectangle
-	Fields: private point PointA, private point PointC
-	Constructors take either non or both points lying on the same diagonal. The rectangle is horizontal, not turned!
-	Methods:
o	 toString() will print „I am Rectangle with PointA, PointB“
o	 randomSize() will set random points A and C
o	 getArea() method will return a number of area covered by rectangle () 
|X1-X2|*|Y1- Y2|
o	 moveIt(int) will increase both points‘ X coordinate.

3.	Inside your main program generate 2 times random Rectangle, 
-	Using toString() method print points.
-	Call moveIt(50)
-	Using toString() method print points.
-	get their area
