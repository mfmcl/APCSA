!This hw can be done later after the class if you can not manage it sooner

1. Study below files in unit4polymorphism
https://github.com/dmicuch-cs/APCSA2021/tree/master/src/a...

Interfaces: iDomesticable, iFlyable, iRunnable, iSwimable
Abstract classes: Aanimal, Abirds, Afish, Aterestrial
Main class Nature.java
Sample animal: Eagle.java

2. Follow the structure of Eagle and create your own two animals (Cow, Dophin, ... )
Use appropriate interfaces and override necessary abstract methods.

3. Change Nature.java as well to test your source code.

4. Share your files in Github or veracross.

Optional â€“ Should you be interested in some combination of interfaces, classes do it
(FROG - amphibian). I would be delighted.
